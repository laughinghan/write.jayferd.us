## About me

I'm a [hacker][github], a systems engineer, a musician, and a student of nonviolence.

[github]: http://github.com/jayferd

## Code I've written
* [iplogic](http://github.com/jayferd/iplogic),
  an IPv4 swiss army chainsaw in ruby.
* [truth](http://github.com/jayferd/truth),
  a library to define and manage truth in a datacenter (WIP).  It's got a sweet declarative ruby DSL.
* [mathquill](http://mathquill.com),
  gui editable math in the browser.  This is a joint project with my good friend [Han Wei][].  Also, awesomesauce.
* [rpgem](http://github.com/jayferd/rpgem),
  an admittedly hacky cli tool to turn gems into binary rpms,
  with specified exterrnal dependencies,
  and no dependencies on a compiler, development headers, or development gems.
